Something is happening here.. wait for it.

Still in plan-phase!
Initial TODO:
- replace die()'s with something fancier
- generic routing
- included main template
- maybe change file-structure

Thanks to (for now):
- Thomas Lemme for his nice small MVC tutorial, for us guys always working in frameworks
- Dalibor Andzakovic <dali@swerve.co.nz>, Matthias Blaser <mb@adfinis.ch>, Frederik Sauer <fsa@dwarf.dk> and Olivier Diotte <olivier+github@diotte.ca> for his awesome TelnetClient.php, for us guys who don't fuc* with telnet and fsockopen stuff
